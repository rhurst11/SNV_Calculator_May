# SNV_Calculator_May

## on Mac from CLI: 
### pip freeze "requirements.txt" to see what the boilerplate / my flask setup is using
### pip install -r requirements.txt

### Information on the boilerplate is labelled boilerplate-README.md in the master branch

### Multiplication issue is not fixed in this iteration, if you want to use this source code I can edit accordingly.
